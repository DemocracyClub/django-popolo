0.0.7
    * Raise an error on (rather than silenty ignore) inline
      areas without an 'id' attribute.
    * Fix the import of areas with parents.
    * Don't error if a source or link is missing 'note'.
0.0.6
    * Many improvements to the code that imports from Popolo JSON
    * Fix the migrations for Python 2 (@wfdd)
0.0.5
    * Sync with upstream (at 3a34d5cb, plus PR #28).
0.0.2
    * Python 3 compatibility changes (James McKinney).
0.0.1
    * Initial release of fork on PyPI. The only difference with upstream is the
      removal of slugs and autoslug, so something using this app can decide how
      it handles them.
