**django-popolo** is a django-based implementation of the `Popolo specifications <http://popoloproject.com/>`_.

It is meant as a django application to be deployed directly within django projects.

It will allow web developers using it to manage and store data according to Popolo's specifications. 

Project is under way and any help is welcome.
